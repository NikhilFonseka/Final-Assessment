				<h1 class="heading"> Influence of Father Rosmini</h1>

				<p class="p"> Rosmini was one of the most influential Italian intellectuals of the nineteenth century. His thought has been compared with
					 that of Parmenides, Plato, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, Schelling, and Hegel. It is impossible to explain and analyze in a single work his 
					 philosophical system in its totality Antonio Rosmini has influence all over the world, his books and life is particularly famous in Rovereto Italy 
					where he was born, and there are plenty of roads named after him in Rovereto and other parts of Italy, there are numerous 
					statues of Rosmini in Rovereto, there is a charity named Rosminians in the UK, And we are a living example of Father Antonio
					 Rosmini influence, the school we are in currently is based on the maxims that Father Antonio Rosmini based hundreds of years ago,
					and without Antonio Rosmini we would not be here today </p>
