				<h1 class="heading"> Life of Blessed Antonio Rosmini</h1>

				<p class="p">Antonio Rosmini Serbati was born on 24 March 1797, at Rovereto to PIER MODESTO, GIOVANNA, Antonio had the good fortune of living a happy childhood, full of innocent fun, open to warm and lasting affections
				The Rosmini household, which included servants and tutors, loved and kept for life, was a very traditional Catholic family, where faith and devotions issued naturally and powerfully
				Antonio manifested an immense love for learning, spending hours in the family library reading ancient and modern classics, with a keen eye for the great works of philosophy and theology, and acquiring an immense erudition	
				He studied at the University of Padua, and was ordained priest at Chioggia, on 21 April 1821. In 1822 he received a Doctorate in Theology and Canon Law. During this time Rosmini formulated his "Principle of Passivity".
				 Rosmini felt compelled to ask himself: Do my plans spring more from my own subjective desire to do good than from a desire to do the will of God?‚Äù. Reflecting in this way, Rosmini articulated the principle in two parts: be ready to undertake any
				work of charity but only so long as it is God's Providence that presents it; in the meantime, immerse oneself in the commitment to continual conversion, seeking the amendment of one's own life.</p>
